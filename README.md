# Cornell Biomedical Knowledge Hub (CBKH)
CBKG integrates data from 18 publicly available biomedical databases. The current version of CBKG contains a total of 2,384,841 entities of 11 types. Specifically, the CBKH includes 22,963 anatomy entities, 18,817 disease entities, 36,759 drug entities, 90,431 gene entities, 2,065,015 molecule entities, 1,361 symptom entities, 4,101 DSI entities, 137,568 DSP entities, 605 TC entities, 2,970 pathway entities and 4,251 side-effect entities. For the relationships in the CBKG (Table 3), there are 101 relation types within 18 kinds of entity pairs, including Anatomy-Gene, Drug-Disease, Drug-Drug, Drug-Gene, Disease-Disease, Disease-Gene, Disease-Symptom, Gene-Gene, DSI-Disease, DSI-Symptom, DSI-Drug, DSI-Anatomy, DSI-DSP, DSI-TC, Disease-Pathway, Drug-Pathway, Gene-Pathway and Drug-Side Effect. In total, CBKH contains 49,709,611 relations.

## Materials and Methods
Our ultimate goal was to build a biomedical knowledge graph via comprehensively incorporating biomedical knowledge as much as possible. To this end, we collected and integrated 18 publicly available data sources to curate a comprehensive one. Details of the used data resources were listed in [Table](https://github.com/houyurain/CBKH/blob/main/Source%20Information/README.md).

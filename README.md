# integrative Biomedical Knowledge Hub (iBKH)
iBKH integrates data from 18 publicly available biomedical databases. The current version of iBKH contains a total of 2,384,501 entities of 11 types. Specifically, the iBKH includes 23,003 anatomy entities, 19,236 disease entities, 37,997 drug entities, 88,376 gene entities, 2,065,015 molecule entities, 1,361 symptom entities, 4,101 DSI entities, 137,568 DSP entities, 605 TC entities, 2,988 pathway entities and 4,251 side-effect entities. For the relationships in the iBKH, there are 86 relation types within 18 kinds of entity pairs, including Anatomy-Gene, Drug-Disease, Drug-Drug, Drug-Gene, Disease-Disease, Disease-Gene, Disease-Symptom, Gene-Gene, DSI-Disease, DSI-Symptom, DSI-Drug, DSI-Anatomy, DSI-DSP, DSI-TC, Disease-Pathway, Drug-Pathway, Gene-Pathway and Drug-Side Effect. In total, iBKH contains 48,194,646 relations.

## Materials and Methods
Our ultimate goal was to build a biomedical knowledge graph via comprehensively incorporating biomedical knowledge as much as possible. To this end, we collected and integrated 18 publicly available data sources to curate a comprehensive one. Details of the used data resources were listed in [Table](Source Information/README.md).

# Alzheimer's Disease Drugs Repurposing via pre-trained embedding

This is an example showing that conduct AD drug repurposing by using iBKH with pre-trained embedding information. We used pre-trained iBKH embedding information from different models as input, then predicted the most likely associated entity with Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

You can find the pre-trained embedding data from different models and the candidate drugs with labels in the following link.
